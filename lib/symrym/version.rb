  # A note on semantic versioning                                    #
  # The versioning principles of 'symrym' will be                    #
  # nearly identical to those followed by ruby and                   #
  # other similar styles. Thus, a version is of the format           #
  # VERSION = x.y.z                                                  #
  # x -> major version                                               #
  # y -> minor version                                               #
  # z -> patch/service update                                        #
  # There is no guarantee of full back compatibility between         #
  # major versions, but within a major version there is full         #
  # back compatibility. This means that code written with            #
  # 0.9 specs, for example, might not run in 1.0, but code written   #
  # with 0.1 specs will run in 0.9.                                  #
