  for calculus, but also for linear algebra, and other mathematic
  applications. This is, by far, inferior to products like mathematica
  or sympy, but is my attempt both to learn how to make a CAS and how
  to implement the features I like in a CAS. Additionally, this is,
  to the best of my knowledge, the first fully fledged CAS in Ruby (or
  at least intends to be by the time it is completed).|
